# Introduction
/* what is a bitmap editor and how does this project emulate it
allows users to paint and edit pictures interactively on the computer screen and save them in one of many popular "bitmap" or "raster" formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF and TIFF.
*/
This project models a bitmap editor in the CLI.
# Usage 
## Setup
### Requirements
(what you need: to run program)
-node.js
-npm (normally comes with Node.js)

## Installation
how to install 
## Linting code
install to lint code
 
# Problem Approach 

## user stories

### Acceptance Criteria

>>>I M N - Create a new M x N image with all pixels coloured white (O).

>>>C - Clears the table, setting all pixels to white (O).

>>>L X Y C - Colours the pixel (X,Y) with colour C.

>>>V X Y1 Y2 C - Draw a vertical segment of colour C in column X between rows Y1 and Y2 (inclusive).

>>>H X1 X2 Y C - Draw a horizontal segment of colour C in row Y between columns X1 and X2 (inclusive).

>>>S - Show the contents of the current image
>>>X - Terminate the session"

NB: Colours are represented by different characters.
Hint: one possible implementation could involve representing the MxN image as a nested array. For example you might represent a 3x3 White image as:
[
  ['O', 'O', 'O'],
  ['O', 'O', 'O'],
  ['O', 'O', 'O'],
]
